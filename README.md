# DeepLearning
## Project Overview
This repository contains the creation and application of Artificial Neuron Network (ANN) focused on developing efficient deep learning models for  galaxy and stars image classification. 

### File Details in this Repository:

- **`RNA3.ipynb`** - Main Jupyter notebook containing:
  - creation of model class artificial_neuron 
  - Forward propagation on training data
  - Backward propagation
  
- **`Ann-model.ipynb`** - Main Jupyter notebook containing:
  - Complete data preprocessing pipeline
  - model training with the dataset galaxy and stars image
  - Plotting and analyzing the loss and accuracy curves.
